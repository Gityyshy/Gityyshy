Benefits:**
Security: When utilizing long enough keys, RSA is highly secure since it relies on the difficulty of factoring huge prime integers.
Versatility: It is adaptable in secure communication and authentication since it can be used for both encryption and digital signatures.
Simplicity in Mathematics: The idea behind it isn't as complicated as some other encryption techniques.
International Approval: It is commonly used and incorporated into many security systems and protocols.
*disadvantages:

Computational Intensity: RSA can have a negative influence on performance due to its slowness during encryption and decryption, particularly when using bigger key sizes.
Key Size: Greater key sizes are required when security levels rise, which may result in higher data overhead.
Vulnerability to Quantum Computing: The advent of quantum computing raises concerns about the security of RSA by perhaps simplifying the factoring of big numbers, which could make some key sizes outdated.
aes

advantages:

Speed: AES is very quick and efficient when implemented in both software and hardware.

Security: When used with the proper key size, it is regarded as being extremely secure.

Versatility: AES is adaptable and simple to use on a range of platforms and systems.

Standardization: A globally recognized standard that guarantees compatibility and interoperability is embraced by governments and businesses everywhere.

disadvantages:

Key Management:** Keeping track of keys can be difficult, particularly for large-scale systems.

Lack of Support for Public Key Operations: Since AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm, it lacks built-in support for public key functions like key exchange and digital signatures.

Potential Vulnerabilities: Although AES hasn't shown any significant flaws, side-channel attacks or poor implementation could jeopardize its security.

fernet

ad:
